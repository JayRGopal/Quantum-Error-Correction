# Quantum Error Correction

## Quick Start

Navigate to `main.py` and input the key to your IBM Quantum account.

Run `main.py` and visualize Quantum Error Correction on a Quantum Computer!

## Exploration

This repository includes an exploration of various algorithms and techniques relevant to quantum computing, including quantum machine learning (QML), Shor's algorithm, and variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs).

See `Tutorials` for Colab notebooks with these explorations.
